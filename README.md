The problem MedFunds solves
Raising funds can be a challenging and risky endeavour, mainly if the methods used to solicit funding are not secure and when it comes to the medical fund for various surgeries that many people can not afford.
They can face problems like fraud, data breach and misuse of funds.
Therby, we have created a platform based on polygon using matic as our test currency on which one can link their crypto wallet and then raise funds or donate to fundraising campaigns

Whenever a person needs to go through treatment and he or she cannot pay for it they can come to our platform where we will be linking them to the best hospitals we have bonds with, their medical conditions will be checked again and will be verified and then a fundraising campaign will be launched on our platform to generate the amount needed.
